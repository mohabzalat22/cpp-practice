# C++ Practice

This repo is for practicing C++ programming.

## Getting Started

To compile a C++ file:

```bash
g++ <dir>/<file_name>.cpp -o ./build/<file_name>
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./build/output_file
```

## What I'm Learning

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- File operations (create, read, write, delete)
- Functions and classes
- Memory management
- Standard Template Library (STL)

Happy coding!
